# Speak Core Workflow A

## Overview
Primary workflow for Speak: AI-powered conversation practice with real-time pronunciation feedback and adaptive tutoring.

## Prerequisites
- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Understanding of Speak core concepts
- Valid API credentials configured
- Audio handling capabilities (for speech input)

## Instructions
1. **Complete Workflow Example**
2. **Topic Categories**

For full implementation details, load: `Read(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation-guide.md)`

## Output
- Completed conversation practice session
- Real-time pronunciation feedback
- Grammar corrections and suggestions
- Session summary with progress metrics
- Next lesson recommendations

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Session Timeout | Exceeded duration | Auto-end with summary |
| Audio Processing Failed | Invalid audio format | Validate audio before submit |
| Tutor Not Responding | API latency | Implement timeout and retry |
| Recognition Failed | Poor audio quality | Prompt user to re-record |

## Resources
- [Speak Conversation API](https://developer.speak.com/api/conversation)
- [Topic Reference](https://developer.speak.com/docs/topics)
- [Audio Requirements](https://developer.speak.com/docs/audio)

## Next Steps

## Examples

### Basic: Start a Conversation Practice Session
```typescript
import { SpeakClient } from "./speak-client";

const client = new SpeakClient(process.env.SPEAK_API_KEY!);

// Start a restaurant ordering scenario in Spanish
const session = await client.startConversation({
  scenario: "ordering-food",
  language: "es",
  level: "intermediate",
});

// Send a student audio turn and get AI tutor feedback
const turn = await client.sendTurn(session.id, "./audio/student-turn-1.wav");
console.log("Tutor response:", turn.tutorText);
console.log("Grammar notes:", turn.corrections);
console.log("Pronunciation score:", turn.pronunciationScore);
```

### Advanced: Multi-Topic Session with Progress Tracking
```typescript
const topics = ["greetings", "directions", "ordering-food"];
const results: SessionResult[] = [];

for (const topic of topics) {
  const session = await client.startConversation({
    scenario: topic,
    language: "es",
    level: "intermediate",
    maxTurns: 6,
    feedbackDetail: "phoneme",
  });

  let turnCount = 0;
  while (!session.isComplete && turnCount < 6) {
    const audioPath = await recordStudentAudio(); // capture mic input
    const turn = await client.sendTurn(session.id, audioPath);
    turnCount++;
    if (turn.pronunciationScore < 60) {
      console.warn(`Low score on turn ${turnCount} — suggest retry`);
    }
  }

  const summary = await client.endSession(session.id);
  results.push({ topic, score: summary.overallScore, turns: turnCount });
}

console.table(results);
```
