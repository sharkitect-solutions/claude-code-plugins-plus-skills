# Speak Core Workflow B

## Overview
Secondary workflow for Speak: Detailed pronunciation training with phoneme-level analysis and targeted practice.

## Prerequisites
- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Familiarity with `speak-core-workflow-a`
- Valid API credentials configured
- High-quality audio input capabilities

## Instructions
1. **Complete Workflow Example**
2. **Workflow Comparison**

For full implementation details, load: `Read(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation-guide.md)`

## Output
- Detailed phoneme-level scores
- Visual pronunciation guides
- Adaptive practice recommendations
- Progress tracking over time
- Weakness identification

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Audio Too Short | Brief recording | Minimum 0.5s audio |
| Background Noise | Poor recording conditions | Prompt for quieter environment |
| Phoneme Not Detected | Unclear speech | Slow down and articulate |
| Model Loading Failed | Network issue | Retry with fallback |

## Examples

### Basic: Pronunciation Assessment with Phoneme Scores
```typescript
import { SpeakClient } from "./speak-client";

const client = new SpeakClient(process.env.SPEAK_API_KEY!);

const result = await client.assessPronunciation({
  audioPath: "./recordings/hello-spanish.wav",
  targetText: "Hola, como estas?",
  language: "es",
  detailLevel: "phoneme",
});

console.log(`Overall score: ${result.score}/100`);
for (const phoneme of result.phonemes) {
  if (phoneme.score < 70) {
    console.log(`  Weak phoneme: "${phoneme.symbol}" — score ${phoneme.score}, tip: ${phoneme.suggestion}`);
  }
}
```

### Advanced: Adaptive Pronunciation Drill Loop
```typescript
async function runPronunciationDrill(client: SpeakClient, phrases: string[], language: string) {
  const weakPoints: Map<string, number[]> = new Map();

  for (const phrase of phrases) {
    const audioPath = await recordStudentAudio(phrase);
    const result = await client.assessPronunciation({
      audioPath,
      targetText: phrase,
      language,
      detailLevel: "phoneme",
    });

    for (const phoneme of result.phonemes.filter((p) => p.score < 70)) {
      const scores = weakPoints.get(phoneme.symbol) || [];
      scores.push(phoneme.score);
      weakPoints.set(phoneme.symbol, scores);
    }

    // Re-drill if overall score is below threshold
    if (result.score < 60) {
      console.log(`Re-drilling: "${phrase}" (score: ${result.score})`);
      const retryAudio = await recordStudentAudio(phrase);
      await client.assessPronunciation({
        audioPath: retryAudio,
        targetText: phrase,
        language,
        detailLevel: "phoneme",
      });
    }
  }

  // Generate weakness report
  const report = [...weakPoints.entries()]
    .map(([phoneme, scores]) => ({
      phoneme,
      avgScore: scores.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / scores.length,
      occurrences: scores.length,
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => a.avgScore - b.avgScore);

  console.log("Pronunciation weakness report:", report);
}
```
