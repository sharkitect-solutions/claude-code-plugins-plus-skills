# Vercel Performance Tuning

## Prerequisites
- Vercel SDK installed
- Understanding of async patterns
- Redis or in-memory cache available (optional)
- Performance monitoring in place

## Instructions

Performance tuning Vercel deployments centers on four levers: reducing JavaScript bundle size (which directly controls Time to Interactive), leveraging Vercel's edge caching for static and dynamic content, minimizing serverless function cold-start time, and moving latency-critical code to Edge Functions which run close to the user without cold-start penalties. Measuring before and after each optimization is essential to confirm impact and justify the added complexity.

### Step 1: Establish Baseline
Measure current performance metrics using Vercel's built-in analytics or Lighthouse. Record Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), serverless function cold-start latency, and cache hit rates for the most-visited routes. Identify which pages or API routes account for the largest share of poor-performing user experiences.

### Step 2: Implement Caching
Configure Vercel's cache-control headers to maximize edge cache utilization for eligible responses. For dynamic pages generated with Next.js ISR or Vercel's `stale-while-revalidate` pattern, set revalidation intervals appropriate to how frequently the underlying data changes. Cache hit rate is the single most impactful metric to improve since it eliminates function invocations entirely.

### Step 3: Enable Batching
Use DataLoader or similar batching libraries to eliminate N+1 query patterns in serverless function handlers. Batching reduces the number of database round-trips per request, which has a multiplicative effect on function latency since each network hop adds cold connection overhead.

### Step 4: Optimize Connections
Configure connection pooling and keep-alive for database connections used inside serverless functions. Since functions may be invoked by many concurrent instances, use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to prevent connection exhaustion at the database level.

## Output
- Baseline Core Web Vitals and function latency documented for target routes
- Edge caching configured with optimized cache-control headers
- N+1 query patterns eliminated through request batching
- Connection pooling configured to prevent database connection exhaustion
