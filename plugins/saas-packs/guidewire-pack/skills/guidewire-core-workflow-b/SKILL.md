# Guidewire Core Workflow B: Claims Processing

## Overview
Master the complete claims lifecycle in ClaimCenter: First Notice of Loss (FNOL), claim investigation, reserve setting, payments, and settlement. Supports auto, property, and general liability claim types.

## Prerequisites
- Completed `guidewire-install-auth` and `guidewire-core-workflow-a`
- Understanding of claims handling processes
- Valid API credentials with claims admin permissions

## Claims Lifecycle States

```
FNOL -> Open -> Investigation -> Evaluation -> Negotiation -> Settlement -> Closed
[Draft] [Open]   [Reserve]      [Exposure]    [Payment]     [Settle]    [Closed]
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create FNOL
1. POST to `/fnol/v1/fnol` with loss date, loss type/cause, description, policy number, loss location, and reporter details
2. Verify the claim number is returned in the response

### Step 2: Add Exposures
1. POST exposures to `/claim/v1/claims/<claimId>/exposures`
2. Specify exposure type (`VehicleDamage`, `BodilyInjury`, or `PropertyDamage`)
3. Set loss party (`insured` or `claimant`) and primary coverage
4. Alternatively, create multiple exposure types on a single claim for complex losses

### Step 3: Add Incidents
1. POST vehicle or property incidents with severity, damage description, and details
2. Link incidents to the corresponding exposures

### Step 4: Set Reserves
1. POST reserves to each exposure specifying reserve line (`indemnity` or `expenses`)
2. Configure cost type, category, and initial reserve amount
3. Adjust reserves as the claim investigation progresses

### Step 5: Create Payments
1. POST payments with payment type (`partial` or `final`)
2. Specify exposure reference, payee, reserve line, amount, and payment method
3. Alternatively, use direct deposit instead of check for faster processing

### Step 6: Close Exposures
1. POST to each exposure's `/close` endpoint with the closed outcome
2. Select outcome: `completed`, `denied`, or `duplicate`

### Step 7: Close Claim
1. Verify all exposures are closed before attempting claim closure
2. POST to `/claim/v1/claims/<claimId>/close` with the final outcome

For complete TypeScript API calls and Gosu server-side implementations, see [implementation guide](references/implementation-guide.md).

## Output
- FNOL claim with assigned claim number
- Exposures linked to applicable coverages
- Reserves set and tracked on exposures
- Payments processed to payees
- Claim closed with documented outcome

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Policy not found | Invalid policy number | Verify policy number and active status |
| Coverage not applicable | Wrong coverage type | Check policy coverages before adding exposure |
| Reserve exceeds limit | Over policy limit | Adjust reserve amount to policy limits |
| Payment validation | Missing required fields | Check payee, amount, and reserve line |
| Cannot close | Open activities or exposures | Complete all pending items before closure |

## Examples

**Auto collision claim**: File an FNOL for a two-vehicle accident. Create `VehicleDamage` and `BodilyInjury` exposures. Set reserves of $5,000 for vehicle repair and $2,000 for medical expenses. Issue a partial payment to the body shop, then close exposures and the claim after settlement.

**Property damage with subrogation**: File an FNOL for water damage at a commercial property. Create a `PropertyDamage` exposure, set indemnity reserves, process payments to the restoration contractor. Alternatively, pursue subrogation against the responsible party and close the claim with recovered amounts.
