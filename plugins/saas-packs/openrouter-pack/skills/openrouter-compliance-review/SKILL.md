# Openrouter Compliance Review

## Overview

This skill provides a framework for reviewing your OpenRouter integration against security, privacy, and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration in use
- Compliance requirements documented (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## Instructions

1. **Inventory data flows**: Map every place where data enters and exits the OpenRouter API — prompts, responses, headers, and logs — to understand your data exposure surface
2. **Review key management**: Verify API keys are stored in environment variables or a secrets manager (never in code), rotated on a schedule, and scoped to minimum required permissions
3. **Check data residency**: Confirm that the models and providers you use process data in regions that comply with your regulatory requirements (check OpenRouter's data processing docs)
4. **Validate logging practices**: Ensure audit logs capture required events without storing sensitive content; verify PII redaction and log retention policies
5. **Document and remediate**: Produce a compliance checklist with pass/fail status for each item; create tickets for any findings that need remediation

## Output

- Data flow diagram showing all touchpoints with the OpenRouter API
- Compliance checklist with pass/fail status for each requirement
- Remediation action items with priority and assignee

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing data flow documentation | Integration added without review | Retroactively document; add compliance review to your deployment checklist |
| Keys in source code | Developer committed credentials | Rotate key immediately; add secret scanning to CI pipeline |
| Non-compliant data residency | Using models hosted in restricted regions | Restrict model selection to compliant providers; use OpenRouter's provider filtering |
