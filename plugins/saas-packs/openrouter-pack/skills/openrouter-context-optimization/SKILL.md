# Openrouter Context Optimization

## Overview

This skill covers techniques for managing token budgets, optimizing prompt length, and making the most of each model's context window.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration
- Tokenizer library (tiktoken for OpenAI models, or approximate counting)

## Instructions

1. **Count tokens before sending**: Use `tiktoken` (Python) or `js-tiktoken` (JS) to estimate token counts before making API calls; abort if the prompt exceeds the model's context limit
2. **Implement conversation pruning**: For multi-turn chats, drop or summarize older messages when total tokens approach the context limit, keeping system prompts and recent messages
3. **Optimize system prompts**: Move static instructions to the system message and keep them concise; every token in the system prompt is repeated on every request
4. **Use response length controls**: Set `max_tokens` to the minimum needed for your use case; shorter completions cost less and return faster
5. **Select models by context need**: Route short-context tasks to cheaper models and reserve large-context models (128K+) for tasks that genuinely need them

## Output

- Token budget calculator that warns before exceeding context limits
- Conversation pruning middleware that keeps chats within context bounds
- Cost reduction from optimized prompt engineering (typically 20-40% savings)

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 400 `context_length_exceeded` | Prompt + max_tokens exceeds model limit | Prune messages or switch to a model with a larger context window |
| Truncated responses | `max_tokens` set too low | Increase `max_tokens` or split the task into smaller requests |
| Token count mismatch | Wrong tokenizer for the model | Use the correct tokenizer per model family; fall back to rough estimation (1 token ~ 4 chars) |
