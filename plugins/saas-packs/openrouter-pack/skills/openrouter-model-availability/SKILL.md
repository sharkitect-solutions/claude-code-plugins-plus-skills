# Openrouter Model Availability

## Overview

This skill covers monitoring model availability on OpenRouter, implementing health checks, and handling model downtime gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration
- List of models your application depends on

## Instructions

1. **Query model status**: Periodically call `GET /api/v1/models` and check if your required models are present; absent models are unavailable
2. **Implement health probes**: Send lightweight test requests (short prompt, `max_tokens: 1`) to each critical model on a schedule to verify end-to-end availability
3. **Track availability metrics**: Log probe results and calculate uptime percentages per model; detect patterns (e.g., models that go down at certain times)
4. **Set up alerts**: Trigger notifications when a critical model fails health checks or disappears from the models list
5. **Automate failover**: When a health check fails, automatically switch to a pre-configured fallback model and log the failover event

## Output

- Health check service that probes critical models on a regular schedule
- Availability dashboard showing uptime percentage per model
- Automated failover that activates when models become unavailable

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Health check timeout | Model is slow or overloaded | Increase probe timeout to 30s; distinguish between "slow" and "down" |
| False positive alerts | Transient network issues triggering alerts | Require 2-3 consecutive failures before alerting; add probe from multiple locations |
| Model removed from catalog | Provider discontinued the model | Subscribe to OpenRouter changelogs; implement model ID aliasing for easy migration |
