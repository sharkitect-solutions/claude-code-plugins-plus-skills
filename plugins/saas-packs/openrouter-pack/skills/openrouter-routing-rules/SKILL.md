# Openrouter Routing Rules

## Overview

This skill shows how to implement rule-based routing that dynamically selects models based on prompt content, user tier, cost constraints, or time-of-day patterns.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration with multiple models configured
- Routing requirements defined (by user tier, task type, cost, etc.)

## Instructions

1. **Define routing dimensions**: Identify the factors that should influence model selection — user tier (free/paid), task type (chat/code/analysis), cost budget, latency requirement
2. **Build a rules engine**: Create a configuration-driven rules engine where each rule has conditions (e.g., `user.tier == "free"`) and actions (e.g., `model = "google/gemma-2-9b-it:free"`)
3. **Implement rule evaluation**: Process rules in priority order; the first matching rule determines the model; always include a default/catch-all rule
4. **Add dynamic rules**: Support rules that query real-time data (current cost, model availability, error rates) to make routing decisions
5. **Test with rule scenarios**: Write test cases for each rule to verify correct model selection under different conditions

## Output

- A configurable rules engine that selects models based on multiple dimensions
- Rule configuration file (JSON/YAML) that can be updated without code changes
- Test suite validating each routing rule produces the correct model selection

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| No rule matched | Conditions don't cover all cases | Always include a default catch-all rule at the end |
| Rule evaluation error | Dynamic rule query failed (e.g., cost API timeout) | Add fallback values for dynamic data; never block on rule evaluation |
| Wrong model selected | Rule priority order incorrect | Add logging to show which rule matched and why; review priority ordering |
