# Openrouter Caching Strategy

## Overview

This skill shows how to implement caching layers for OpenRouter responses to reduce costs, lower latency, and handle repeated queries efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration
- Cache storage (in-memory, Redis, or filesystem)

## Instructions

1. **Generate cache keys**: Hash the model ID, messages array, and key parameters (temperature, max_tokens) into a deterministic cache key
2. **Implement exact-match caching**: Store responses keyed by the hash; return cached responses for identical requests (works best with `temperature: 0`)
3. **Add TTL-based expiration**: Set cache entries to expire after a configurable period (e.g., 1 hour for factual queries, 5 minutes for dynamic content)
4. **Consider semantic caching**: For fuzzy matching, use embedding similarity to find cached responses for semantically similar (but not identical) prompts
5. **Track cache hit rates**: Log cache hits vs misses to measure cost savings and tune your caching strategy

## Output

- Cache hit rate metrics showing percentage of requests served from cache
- Cost savings report comparing cached vs uncached request costs
- Latency improvement measurements (cached responses return in <5ms vs 500ms+ for API calls)

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Stale cached responses | TTL too long for dynamic content | Reduce TTL or add cache invalidation triggers |
| Cache key collisions | Hash function not including all relevant parameters | Include model, messages, temperature, max_tokens, and tools in the key |
| Memory pressure | In-memory cache growing unbounded | Set max cache size with LRU eviction; use Redis for large caches |
