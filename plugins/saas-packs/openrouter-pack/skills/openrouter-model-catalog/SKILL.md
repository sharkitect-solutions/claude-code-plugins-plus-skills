# Openrouter Model Catalog

## Overview

This skill teaches you how to query the OpenRouter models API, filter by capabilities, and select the right model for your use case.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter API key configured
- Basic understanding of LLM model differences

## Instructions

1. **Fetch the model list**: GET `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` to retrieve all available models with pricing, context length, and capability metadata
2. **Filter by criteria**: Parse the response to filter models by `context_length`, `pricing.prompt`, `pricing.completion`, or provider prefix (e.g., `anthropic/`, `openai/`)
3. **Check model capabilities**: Look at the `supported_parameters` field to verify features like function calling, streaming, or JSON mode
4. **Compare pricing**: Sort models by cost per million tokens to find the best value for your workload
5. **Cache results**: Store the catalog locally with a TTL of 1 hour since model availability changes infrequently

## Output

- Full model catalog JSON with IDs, pricing, and context lengths
- Filtered model lists by capability (e.g., function-calling models, free models)
- Cost comparison table for your shortlisted models

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Empty model list | API returned no models | Check API key permissions; free keys may have limited access |
| Stale pricing data | Using cached data too long | Set cache TTL to 1 hour and refetch periodically |
| Model ID not found | Model was removed or renamed | Re-query the catalog; model IDs change when providers update versions |
