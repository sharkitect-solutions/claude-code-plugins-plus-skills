# Openrouter Model Routing

## Overview

This skill teaches you how to build intelligent routing logic that selects the best model based on task complexity, cost constraints, or latency requirements.

## Prerequisites

- OpenRouter integration with multiple models tested
- Understanding of model capabilities and pricing differences

## Instructions

1. **Classify request complexity**: Analyze the incoming prompt to determine if it needs a simple, mid-tier, or advanced model (e.g., by token count, keyword patterns, or task type)
2. **Build a routing table**: Map task categories to model IDs — e.g., simple Q&A to `google/gemma-2-9b-it:free`, code generation to `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, reasoning to `openai/gpt-4-turbo`
3. **Implement the router function**: Create a function that takes a prompt and returns the appropriate model ID based on your classification logic
4. **Add cost guardrails**: Set per-request `max_tokens` and budget caps to prevent expensive models from exceeding cost limits
5. **Monitor and tune**: Log which model handles each request and track quality metrics to adjust routing thresholds over time

## Output

- A routing function that selects models based on task type and constraints
- Cost savings from using cheaper models for simple tasks
- Quality metrics per route to validate routing decisions

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Wrong model selected | Classification logic too simple | Add more granular task categories; test with diverse prompts |
| Model unavailable | Selected model is temporarily down | Chain to fallback model (see openrouter-fallback-config) |
| Cost overrun | Complex tasks routed to expensive models | Set hard `max_tokens` limits and daily budget caps |
