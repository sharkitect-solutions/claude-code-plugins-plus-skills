# Deepgram Local Dev Loop

## Overview
Set up an efficient local development workflow for Deepgram integration with fast feedback cycles, test fixtures, and mock responses for offline development.

## Prerequisites
- Completed `deepgram-install-auth` setup
- Node.js 18+ with npm/pnpm or Python 3.10+
- Sample audio files for testing
- Environment variables configured in `.env`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Project Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src tests fixtures
touch src/transcribe.ts tests/transcribe.test.ts
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Files
```bash
# .env.development
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-dev-api-key
DEEPGRAM_MODEL=nova-2
```

### Step 3: Download Test Fixtures
```bash
set -euo pipefail
curl -o fixtures/sample.wav https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-podcast.wav
```

### Step 4: Set Up Watch Mode
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch src/transcribe.ts",
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Create Mock Responses
Build mock response objects that mirror the Deepgram API structure for offline testing. Use these mocks to avoid API calls during unit tests and CI runs.

### Step 6: Run Tests and Iterate
Execute `npm test` to run the test suite against fixtures. Alternatively, use `npm run test:watch` for continuous feedback during development.

For complete TypeScript dev entry point, Vitest test setup, mock response objects, and alternative test framework options, see [test setup reference](references/test-setup.md).

## Output
- Project structure with src, tests, and fixtures directories
- Environment files for development and testing
- Watch mode scripts for rapid iteration
- Mock responses for offline test execution

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Fixture Not Found | Missing audio file | Run fixture download script |
| Env Not Loaded | dotenv not configured | Install and configure dotenv |
| Watch Mode Fails | Missing tsx | Install tsx: `npm i -D tsx` |
| API Rate Limited | Too many dev requests | Use cached mock responses in tests |

## Examples

**Quick dev setup**: Create the project structure, download the NASA podcast fixture, configure `.env` with the API key, and run `tsx watch src/transcribe.ts` for live reloading during development.

**Offline test suite**: Create mock response objects matching the Deepgram API shape, inject them into tests via dependency injection or module mocking, and run `vitest` without any network calls.
