# Deepgram SDK Patterns

## Overview
Production patterns for the Deepgram speech-to-text SDK. Covers client initialization, pre-recorded transcription, live streaming, speaker diarization, and batch processing with proper error handling and concurrency control.

## Prerequisites
- `pip install deepgram-sdk` or `npm install @deepgram/sdk`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` environment variable configured
- Audio files or microphone access for testing

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Client

```python
from deepgram import DeepgramClient, PrerecordedOptions, LiveOptions
import os

def get_deepgram_client() -> DeepgramClient:
    return DeepgramClient(os.environ["DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"])
```

```typescript
import { createClient, DeepgramClient } from '@deepgram/sdk';
const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY!);
```

### Step 2: Configure Transcription Options
Set model (`nova-2` for best accuracy), enable `smart_format` for clean output, and add `diarize` for multi-speaker scenarios. Alternatively, use `enhanced` or `base` models for faster processing at lower cost.

### Step 3: Implement Pre-Recorded Transcription
Open the audio file, detect MIME type, and call the REST transcription endpoint. Extract transcript text, confidence score, and word-level timing from the response.

### Step 4: Add Live Streaming (Optional)
Create an async WebSocket connection with `LiveOptions`. Register event handlers to process interim and final results in real time.

### Step 5: Implement Batch Processing
Process multiple files concurrently using an asyncio semaphore to respect rate limits. Gather results with `asyncio.gather` and handle exceptions per-file.

For complete Python and TypeScript implementations including pre-recorded transcription, streaming, batch processing, and speaker-labeled formatting, see [code patterns](references/code-patterns.md).

## Output
- Production-ready client initialization with environment-based configuration
- Pre-recorded transcription with word-level timing and speaker labels
- Batch processing pipeline with configurable concurrency
- Live streaming connection with interim result handling

## Error Handling
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API key | Check `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` value |
| `400 Unsupported format` | Bad audio codec | Convert to WAV/MP3/FLAC |
| Empty transcript | No speech in audio | Check audio quality and volume |
| WebSocket disconnect | Network instability | Implement reconnection logic |

## Examples

**Pre-recorded with diarization**: Call `transcribe_file("meeting.wav")` with `diarize=True`, then iterate over words grouping by `speaker` field to produce speaker-labeled output like `Speaker 0: Hello everyone...`.

**Batch processing**: Pass a list of 50 audio file paths to `batch_transcribe` with `max_concurrent=5`. Review results for errors and retry failed files individually.
