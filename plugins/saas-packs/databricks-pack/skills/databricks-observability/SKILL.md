# Databricks Observability

## Overview
Monitor Databricks job runs, cluster utilization, query performance, and costs using system tables and the Databricks SDK. Databricks exposes observability data through system tables in the `system` catalog (audit logs, billing, compute, query history) and real-time Ganglia metrics on clusters.

## Prerequisites
- Databricks Premium or Enterprise with Unity Catalog enabled
- Access to `system.billing`, `system.compute`, and `system.access` catalogs
- SQL warehouse or cluster for running monitoring queries

## Instructions

### Step 1: Monitor Job Health via System Tables
```sql
-- Failed jobs in the last 24 hours with error details
SELECT job_id, run_name, result_state, start_time, end_time,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time) AS duration_min,
       error_message
FROM system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline
WHERE result_state = 'FAILED'
  AND start_time > current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### Step 2: Track Cluster Utilization and Costs
```sql
-- DBU consumption by cluster over the last 7 days
SELECT cluster_id, cluster_name, sku_name,
       SUM(usage_quantity) AS total_dbus,
       SUM(usage_quantity * list_price) AS estimated_cost_usd
FROM system.billing.usage
WHERE usage_date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
GROUP BY cluster_id, cluster_name, sku_name
ORDER BY estimated_cost_usd DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Step 3: Monitor SQL Warehouse Performance
```sql
-- Slow queries (>30s) on SQL warehouses
SELECT warehouse_id, statement_id, executed_by,
       total_duration_ms / 1000 AS duration_sec,  # 1000: 1 second in ms
       rows_produced, bytes_scanned_mb
FROM system.query.history
WHERE total_duration_ms > 30000  # 30000: 30 seconds in ms
  AND start_time > current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS
ORDER BY total_duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Step 4: Set Up Alerts with Databricks SQL Alerts
```sql
-- Create alert: notify if any job fails more than 3 times in an hour
-- In Databricks SQL > Alerts > New Alert:
-- Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS failure_count
FROM system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline
WHERE result_state = 'FAILED'
  AND start_time > current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
-- Trigger when: failure_count > 3
-- Notification: Slack webhook or email
```

### Step 5: Export Metrics to External Systems
```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

w = WorkspaceClient()

# Export cluster metrics to Prometheus via pushgateway
for cluster in w.clusters.list():
    if cluster.state == 'RUNNING':
        events = w.clusters.events(cluster.cluster_id, limit=10)
        # Push utilization metrics to your monitoring stack
        push_metric('databricks_cluster_state', 1, labels={'cluster': cluster.cluster_name, 'state': cluster.state.value})
```

## Error Handling
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| System tables empty | Unity Catalog not enabled | Enable Unity Catalog for the workspace |
| Query history missing | Serverless warehouse not tracked | Use classic SQL warehouse or check retention |
| Billing data delayed | System table lag (up to 24h) | Use for trend analysis, not real-time alerting |
| Cluster metrics gaps | Cluster was terminated | Check terminated cluster events in audit log |

## Examples

### Daily Health Dashboard Query
```sql
-- Single-pane health summary for daily standups
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN result_state = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 END) AS succeeded,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN result_state = 'FAILED' THEN 1 END) AS failed,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN result_state = 'TIMED_OUT' THEN 1 END) AS timed_out,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN result_state = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS success_rate_pct,
    ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time)), 1) AS avg_duration_min
FROM system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline
WHERE start_time > current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS;
```

### Cost-per-Job Breakdown
```sql
SELECT j.name AS job_name,
       COUNT(*) AS run_count,
       ROUND(SUM(b.usage_quantity), 1) AS total_dbus,
       ROUND(SUM(b.usage_quantity * b.list_price), 2) AS total_cost_usd
FROM system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline r
JOIN system.lakeflow.jobs j ON r.job_id = j.job_id
LEFT JOIN system.billing.usage b ON r.cluster_id = b.cluster_id
WHERE r.start_time > current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
GROUP BY j.name
ORDER BY total_cost_usd DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

## Output
- Job health dashboard showing success/failure rates over time
- Top cost drivers ranked by DBU consumption
- Slow query report identifying warehouses needing right-sizing
- SQL alerts for automated failure notifications
- External metric export pipeline for Prometheus/Grafana integration
