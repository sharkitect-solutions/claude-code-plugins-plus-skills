# Granola Upgrade & Migration

## Current State
!`npm list 2>/dev/null | head -20`
!`pip freeze 2>/dev/null | head -20`

## Overview
Guide for upgrading Granola app versions and migrating between subscription plans. Covers auto-update configuration, plan upgrades and downgrades, data export/import, and enterprise migrations from competing tools.

## Prerequisites
- Current Granola version information (Menu > About Granola)
- Admin access for organization-level changes
- Data backup before major upgrades

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Current Version
```bash
# macOS - Check installed version
defaults read /Applications/Granola.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString
```

### Step 2: Configure Auto-Updates
Navigate to Granola > Preferences > General. Enable "Check for updates automatically" and "Download updates in background."

### Step 3: Upgrade App Version
```bash
# macOS via Homebrew
brew update
brew upgrade --cask granola
```
Alternatively, download the latest version directly from granola.ai/download.

### Step 4: Upgrade Subscription Plan
Navigate to Settings > Account > Subscription. Select the target plan (Pro, Business, or Enterprise) and complete the upgrade flow. Plan features activate immediately with prorated billing.

```
Upgrade Path: Free → Pro → Business → Enterprise
- Immediate access to new features
- No data loss during upgrade
- Prorated billing applied
```

### Step 5: Export Data Before Downgrades
Before downgrading, export all data via Settings > Data > Export in Markdown or JSON format. Verify the export contains all notes, transcripts, and action items.

For complete update troubleshooting, plan upgrade details, data import/export procedures, rollback steps, and enterprise migration checklists, see [migration procedures](references/migration-procedures.md).

## Output
- Granola updated to latest version
- Subscription plan changed with features activated
- Data exported and verified before any downgrades

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Update fails to install | Cached data conflict | Delete ~/Library/Caches/Granola and retry |
| App crashes after update | Corrupted preferences | Clear preferences and re-authenticate |
| Billing error on upgrade | Payment method expired | Update payment method in Account settings |

## Examples

**Version upgrade**: Run `brew update && brew upgrade --cask granola` to update. Verify with `defaults read /Applications/Granola.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString`. Clear caches if the update fails.

**Plan migration with data preservation**: Export all data as JSON before downgrading from Business to Pro. Document active integrations (they disconnect on downgrade), notify team members, and re-import critical notes after the downgrade completes.
